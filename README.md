# creature

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the package is to create a creature that will accompany you
when you feel lonely. You will find it at the bottom of your Rmd
document or Shiny app. The creature was initially developed by [Justin
Windle](https://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/), I’ve just found it cool
and adapted it to R. You can say this is an R wrapper.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/creature")
```

## Example

A demo is available
[here](https://ihaddadenfodil.com/post/introducing-the-creature-package-interactive-animations-in-rmd-documents-and-shiny-apps/)
